# Stanford193p-SET
Implemented the SET card game using SwiftUI from scratch. The rules to the game can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game).
Some of the features I included are having the cards fly in at the beginning of the game to give the illusion of the cards being dealed, adding an option
to add 3 more cards, drawing custom shapes, and having the cards light up to indicate selection/match/no match.
